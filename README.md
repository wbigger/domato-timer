# Domato Timer
A pxt-microbit timer for the Pomodoro TechinqueÂ®

# How it works
Microbit has 25 leds and 2 buttons, an ideal platform to realize a pomodoro-like timer.

When just started, the display shows a welcome screen with a triangle.

Clicking on the A button (on the left), you start a pomodoro. Just after the click, for a few moments the display show you the number of this pomodoro (since the last reboot).

Then the pomodoro starts. Each led is a minute, and at the very beginning all the leds are turned on. Every minute, a LED goes off.

During the last minute, the last led blinks, to catch the attention of the user. Note that since Microbit does not have a loud speaker, blinking is the easier way to catch attention. And it doesn't bother your room mate :)

When the pomodoro ends, a confirmation screen is shown. Again, blinking.

At any moment you can press the B button (on the right) to start a break. Leds during the break are shown in the lower part of the microbit, to easily distinguish work and break time at a glance.

Each time you press the B button, you add 5 minutes to the break. That is, if you want to start a long break of 15 minutes, just press the B button three times.

When the break ends, a blinking confirmation screen is shown, with the shape of a diamond.

That's all! Enjoy!

## About the name
